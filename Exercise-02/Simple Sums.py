#Exercise 2: simple sums

Hi = 8 #declaring the variable 'Hi' with an integer value of 8 as the first operant
Hey = 10 #declaring the variable 'Hey' with an integer value of 10 as the second operant
Hello = Hi + Hey #Variable 'Hello' is declared as the sum of 'Hi' and 'Hey' by using the + operator
print (Hello) #so when we print C, it will print the sum of both variables
